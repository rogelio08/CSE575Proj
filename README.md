# CSE575Proj
This project consists of a lunge disease detection model, trained from chest x-ray datasets, that creates models to classify various illnesses and report on regions of interest among the x-rays.
To run this project download the '575_final_version.ipynb' folder and open in an environement such as kaggle or google collab (though it is heavily advised to use kaggle as it includes the various datasets the program uses)
and run within the softwares editor. Each of the cells can also be run manually for more specific analysis. If you want to see the proof of concept then follow the same steps only with the 'poc-v2.ipynb' file instead.
